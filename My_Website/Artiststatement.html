    <p><b>Eddy J. Benitez</b><br><br>Being able to have control over things is  such a satisfying feeling. Being able to control the steering wheel and going to places of your choose, as well as making your own decisions is what people want. The power to live life the way they want and if a mistake were to be made, restart and try again, this is what we as humans want. This makes us happy and at ease. This kind of power is given by video games. </p>
